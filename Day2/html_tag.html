    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>
      This week I am
      <i>extremely</i>
      excited about cooking technique called
      <i>sous vide</i>
      . In
      <i>sous vide</i>
      cooking, you summered the food(usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a
      water bath thar is appreciable set to the target temperature you want the
      food to be cooked to. In his book,
      <i>Cooking fir Greeks</i>
      , Jeff Potter describes ir as " ultra-low temperature poaching".

      Next month, we will be serving
      <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>
      .To reserve a seat ar the chef table, contact us before November 30.
